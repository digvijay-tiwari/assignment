Problem

Redis is an in-memory database used to store keys and values. Once the Redis server is running, you can use a Redis cli to interact with it. This task involves writing a mini Redis server. Essentially following commands should be supported:

1.	connect to Redis using redis-cli
2.	Run a SET command with the key as string and value as either string or integer
3.	Run a GET command with the key as a string
